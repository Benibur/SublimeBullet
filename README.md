# SublimeBullet (version 0.1.1)

This is a Sublime Text plugin for markdown style Bullet points and Number lists. It automatically add * , +and - for unordered lists, > for blockquotes, and numbered items for number lists.

## Installation

1. Download the package from https://github.com/downloads/erinata/SublimeBullet/SublimeBullet-0.1.0.zip
2. Extract the folder SublimeBullet
3. Copy the SublimeBullet folder to the package folder of SublimeText 2

## Usage

In markdown files, * , + and - are automatically added for unordered lists (aka bullet points). Similarly > are automatically added for multiline blockquote.

For ordered lists, the new item will use a number next to the previous item. For example when you hit "enter" after typing "1. Item one", "2. " will be added automatically to the next line. 

I may add other bullet point style later. For now it only support markdown style.

## Operating Systems

I only tested this on Windows, I hope that it works on OSX and Linux.
